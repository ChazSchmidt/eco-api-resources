# Provide ECO API Resource Hub

## About

The Provide ECO API simplifies and accelerates the way in which companies integrate sustainability into their applications and core business processes. This repo outlines resources to assist in your use of the ECO API for acquiring/retiring carbon offsets and verifying scope 3 carbon emissions data through zero knowledge proofs

## Getting Started

### Set up your self-sovereign identity, API credentials through Provide Shuttle (Pre-req)

The ECO API relies upon the creation of a self-sovereign identity (e.g. a decentralized identity aka "DID") to serve as the common set of API credentials. 

Never used self-sovereign identity / DIDs before? Don't sweat it. The process to create and integrate one is very simple. Check out this video to learn how to use Provide Shuttle to generate your DID. Once completed, you're ready for your first carbon retirement!.

### Execute an on-demand carbon retirement on KlimaDAO, Polygon via Postman

Ready to start retiring carbon on-demand? After creating your DID - you can complete your first carbon retirement through the ECO API Postman starter kit. Execute each Postman request in order.
