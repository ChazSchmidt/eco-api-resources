# Provide ECO API Billing

While cryptocurrencies are used to pay gas fees and acquire/retire carbon, individual ECO API users are not required to hold any digital assets. A technique known as account abstraction enables the ECO API to pay fees on the user's behalf. This enables the ECO to conduct transcations and monitor usage for billing.

Credit/Debit card as well as conventional invoice payment options will be supported. Check back soon for more details!
