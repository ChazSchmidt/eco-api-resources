# ECO API specification

## About

The ECO API for carbon retirement is documented in greater detail [here](https://docs.provide.services/payments/eco/api)

### Underlying architecture

The Provide ECO API leverages the open source Provide web3 microservices framework. 

- Ident for decentralized identity

- Vault for digital wallet, secrets management, and other cryptography tools 

- Nchain for EVM and other blockchain connectivity

- Axiom for composable zero knowledge workflows

- Privacy for general purpose zero knowledge capababilities

You can read general documentation for these APIs [here](https://docs.provide.services)

The open source repos for these services are located as follows

| *** Service *** | *** Github *** |
| Ident | https://github.com/provideplatform/ident |
| Vault | https://github.com/provideplatform/vault |
| Nchain | https://github.com/provideplatform/nchain |
| Axiom | https://github.com/provideplatform/axiom |
| Privacy | https://github.com/provideplatform/privacy |

You can check out a general set of API specs and Postman collections of all the Provide microservices [here](https://github.com/provideplatform/provide-postman). Check this repo for OpenAPI and Swagger docs. Several language specific SDKs are also available to support your ECO API integrations.
